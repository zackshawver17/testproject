This project presents a POS system solution designed for YiFang Tea, a boba tea chain. The need at hand is an efficient and user-friendly 
interface design, which can be utilized by cashiers to process orders quickly and by managers to access accurate inventory and order history 
data. Our database framework consolidates multiple entities that each serve a specific purpose: an item entity to store information about different 
menu items, an order entity to record information about customer orders, an item_order join table to reference which items belong to which 
orders, and an ingredient entity to help manage inventory levels. Read below for more information.
